# TESTING.md — Skillchains Resonance UI

**Start here.** Cumulative development and testing record; not a claim of live validation.

## Current testing batch — 2026-10-13 / v0.1

**Branch:** `resonance-ui-v0.1-test`; master remains at its previous live baseline.
**Status:** User confirmed the addon loads and basic commands work in FFXI; combat/visual behavior not yet tested.
**Delivery:** Download this branch as a ZIP and keep the three Lua files together.
**Contents:** `Skillchains.lua`, `skills.lua`, `resonance_ui.lua`, README and
the four development documents. No `settings.xml`, launcher scripts, or EnemyBar2
changes are included.
**Precaution:** Back up your current Skillchains folder and its `data` before replacing files.

### First in-game tests

1. **Load without combat:** `//lua reload Skillchains` (or load it fresh).
   Confirm one status/error-free start, then run `//sc` and `//sc help`.
2. **Independent dragging:** `//sc edit`; move `SC BAR` and the learning panel
   independently, exit edit; reload and confirm positions persist. The edit screen
   shows a *static placeholder* for positioning, **not** a simulated skillchain sequence.
3. **Scaling:** `//sc scale edit`; drag horizontal scale handle left/right;
   `//sc edit off`; try `//sc scale 0.8`; verify panel and bars resize without
   changing the manually chosen bar width. Try `//sc width 310`.
4. **Display choices:** On a melee character verify `//sc display sc` (default),
   `//sc display mb`, `//sc display both`; switching main/subjob must **not**
   automatically change the choice.
5. **Actual chain:** With a living targeted monster, perform two compatible weapon
   skills. Look for muted waiting resonance, brighter open state, diminishing bar,
   then separate Magic Burst window after the chain. Check time with a stopwatch
   if available; neither countdown is yet live-calibrated.
6. **Learning panel:** `//sc mode learn` should list **all learned compatible**
   actions grouped by result, not by weapon or alphabet alone. Confirm `compact`
   drops actions and `minimal` displays only bars.
7. **Window independence:** `display both`; allow the SC continuation to end
   while the MB opportunity remains. If a chain is closed, verify MB still appears.
8. **Target lifecycle:** Switch among live mobs during a window and switch back;
   kill the target; zone; reload; log out; enter/exit a cutscene. Report any stale
   graphical objects, wrong target, failure to hide, or console errors.
9. **Resolutions:** Validate separately on Franklet's ~1280×709 client and a larger
   client such as Cioara. Verify positions and that the learning panel isn't offscreen.
10. **Multibox:** With several instances, check no cross-client state bleed,
    UI lag, or duplicate/stacked primitives after reload.

### Evidence to return

The most useful first feedback is one in-combat screenshot of Skillchain-only Learn
mode, one screenshot in `display both` after completing a chain, and **any Windower
console errors copied verbatim**. Note character/job/target and whether timing
felt early or late. We can adjust colors and alignment from the screenshots.

## Checks completed before delivery

- Compared original and posimagi action tables; refreshed the fork's `skills.lua`.
- Reviewed Windower `texts` APIs for draggable text, positioning, font size,
  and text updates; reviewed XIVCrossbar's previous skillchain timing implementation.
- Performed a **lightweight source lexical/bracket/block-balance check** against
  all three Lua files (passed). This is **not** Lua 5.1 compilation, full
  syntax validation, a runtime smoke test, or proof of timer correctness.
- Source review also corrected an older unguarded equipment lookup and verified primitive API names.
- GitHub branch writes were verified after editing; no private FFXI instance
  was accessible for runtime testing.

### Known limitations / questions

- EnemyBar2 attachment is visual/manual, not live position synchronization.
- Gradient palette remains provisional pending comparison to actual FFXI effects.
- Original timing heuristics are retained where practical; separate MB expiry
  is currently modeled as 10 seconds after the skillchain result. Verify live.
- Skill suggestions reflect learned ability lists, **not** TP/recast readiness.
- Large suggestion groups may extend past small-screen boundaries; report layout.
- Cutscene and zone hiding need live confirmation; addon has no direct
  EnemyBar2 cutscene-state dependency.
- No automatic magic-job detection (explicitly deferred).
- No Japanese names or timed preview/simulation (explicitly excluded).

## Previous tests and checks

- **2026-10-13, user-confirmed in-game smoke test:** Skillchains loaded and basic commands worked. Exact commands and combat/visual checks were not specified. User was still preparing the full test environment. Previous master behavior has not been
reconstructed as a verified regression baseline; preserve master until a live pass
is accepted.

rather than silently deleting prior entries.
